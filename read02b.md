Git is a version control system that helps to track changes to files.

So you can update and change on files and git will help you to determine what changed .

we can collaborate on Git projects, by using remote commands , 

Git files pass through three stages:

modified, staged, commited.

The local Git repository has 3 components:

Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
Index: The area used for staging
Head: Points to the most recent commit
