# HTML 

### 1. Headings

HTML has six "levels" of headings

### 2. Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening tag and closing tag.

### 3.Bold & Italic

By enclosing words in the tags b and /b we can make characters appear bold.

By enclosing words in the tags i and /i we can make characters appear italic.

### 4.Superscript & Subscrip

The sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts

### 5.Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading 
on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can 
use the line break tag br .

### Semantic Markup

What Is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.
 
Examples of semantic HTML tags include:

* Header tags h1 through h6.

* blockquote

* code

* em

# CSS 

CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear .

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# JAVASCRIPT 

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. 

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

* Expressions evaluate into a single value. 

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

 ### LOOP 

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
* if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
