# The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code:

* The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.

* During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.

* Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.
