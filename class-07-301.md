A Conversation about REST with my brother:

1-Who is Roy Fielding?

* He helped write the first web servers and His name is on the specification for the HTTP protocol.

2-Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

* Because they weren't designed to be used like that they just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3-What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

* It's all about add GET,PUT,DELETE..etc to the web,so when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4-What does a GET do?

* To obtain resources (image, text, video, an mp3) from the web

5-What does a POST do?

* To add something to another system.

6-What does PUT do?

* To update something in another system.

7-What does PATCH do?

* To partial update something in another system.
