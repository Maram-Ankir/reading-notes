## Objects :

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.

If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties tell us about the object.

If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object

Types of literals:

* Array literals
* Boolean literals
* Floating-point literals
* Numeric literals
* Object literals
* RegExp literals
* String literals

## The Document Object Model (DOM) :

DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 


* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
* You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 
* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st. 
* From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML .
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .  


### METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE:

* getElementByld('id')

* querySel ector('css selector')

* getElementsByTagName('tagName')

* querySelectorAll (css select or)
