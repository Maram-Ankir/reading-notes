  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>{listItems}</ul>,
  document.getElementById('root')
  );

let arr2 = [3, 5, 7];
let primes = [...arr1, ...arr2];
// > [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]

```

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
