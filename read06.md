# CSS

we use css to add style and desgin to the website , such like : color the website .

Color can really bring your pages to life.

● How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in which you can indicate your choice of colors.

### Foreground color :

● The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

 1- rgb values   
 
 2- hex codes    
  
 3-color names

### Background-color :

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

### Contrast :

When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

###  Opacity:

allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 

The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 .

CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

### Hsl, Hsla:

The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.

 The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for :

* hue

* saturation

* lightness

* alpha
