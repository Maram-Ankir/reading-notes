# Stacks and Queues

* Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

* Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

## FIFO & LILO and LIFO & FILO Principles :

* Queue: First In First Out (FIFO): The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.

* Stack: Last In First Out (LIFO): The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack

OR

* Stack: Last In First Out (FILO): The First object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.

* Queue: Last In First Out (LILO): The last object or item in a queue is the last object or item to leave the queue.

## Common terminology for a queue is

Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
FIFO (First In First Out) : This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.
LILO : Last In Last Out


## Push O(1): 

* Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.


## Pop O(1) : 

* create a reference named temp that points to the same Node that top points to.
* re-assign top
* clear out the next property in your current temp reference
* return the value of the temp Node that was just popped off.
* pseudocode for a pop

## Peek O(1)

must be check if empty pseudocode for a peek
ALGORITHM peek() // INPUT <-- none // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack // EXCEPTION if stack is empty return top.value
