# Mongo and Mongoose

1-Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:


| SQL              | NoSQL         |
| -------------    | ------------- |
|realation database| Non-relational database  |
|pre-defind schema | dynamic schema  |
|good for complex queries|	not a good fit for complex querie|	
|table based databases|	document-based databases, key-value stores,graph stores,wide column stores|
|not the best fit|	fits a better when compared to SQL|
|vertically scalable|	horizontally scalable|



2-What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
* Table based databases

3-Give a real world example.
* human resources manager

4-What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
* the hierarchical data storage

5-Give a real world example.
* companies like Twitter

6-Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
* NoSQL database

7-Which type of database is best for scalability?
* SQL database

1-What does SQL stand for?
* Structured Query Language.

2-What is a realational database?
* A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3-What type of structure does a relational database work with?
* Structured Query Language like table , products table

4-What is a ‘schema’?
* ts structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases)

5-What is a NoSQL database?
* NoSQL databases ("not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model

6-Howo does it work?
* accommodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document

7-What is inside of a Mongo database?
* MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

8-Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
* NoSQL databases are better with semi-structured and unstructured data and are generally more flexible than SQL databases.

9-What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
* Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
