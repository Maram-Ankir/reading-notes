HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content

The new semantic tags are :

1-Headers & Footers 
<header> <footer> The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

2-Navigation <nav>

 The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

3-Articles <article>

 The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

4-Asides <aside> 

The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

5-Sections <section>

 The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading

6-Heading Groups <hgroup>

The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 

7-Figures <figure> <fig caption> 

It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

DOCTYPE tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

 We can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.

The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
