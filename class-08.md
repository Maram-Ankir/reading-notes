## CSS Layout:

* CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative .

* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:

1-normal flow

2-relative positioning

3- absolute positioning

* z-index : property specifies the stack order of an element.

* position : property sets how an element is positioned in a document. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

* position: static ; positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

* position: relative ; is positioned relative to its normal position.

* position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

* position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

* float : property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

* clear : property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

* Flexbox : is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.
 Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. 

* Grid : Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. 

*  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
