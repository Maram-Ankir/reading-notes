# Status Codes Based On REST Methods:

* In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body 200’s = telling the client that its request was accepted 300’s = telling the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available 400’s = invalid requests a client sent to a server 500’s = unreachable servers

* What is a status code 202?

Used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.(1)

* What is a status code 308?

This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore.(1)

204 code

* What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
