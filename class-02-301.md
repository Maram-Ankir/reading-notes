## React lifecycle 

1-Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

- the ‘render’ happens before the ‘componentDidMount’.

2- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

- The Render phase

3- Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates?

* constructor
* render()
* componentDidMount()
* React Updates
* componentWillUnmount

4- What does componentDidMount do?

The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). 
This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle

## React State Vs Props

1- What types of things can you pass in the props?

- The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects,etc..

2- What is the big difference between props and state?

* Props pass into a component.

* Props is handled outside of that component.

* Props is update it outside the component.

* State is handled inside of that component.

* State is update it inside the component.

 Also ,the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters.

3- When do we re-render our application?

- when we change the state inside our application
 

4- What are some examples of things that we could store in state ?

Based on user input :

* Input Elements.
* Check Box.
* Select Box.

we always use state for storing that data which may be a string , number or any complex object
